# MidiSynthPolyRhythmsTemplate

This project is a Java application created on Eclipse that showcases the use of MIDI synthesis and polyrhythms using the Java Sound API. It includes various classes that demonstrate how to generate MIDI sequences and play multiple melodies simultaneously.

## Usage

This application demonstrates how to create MIDI sequences for different melodies, play them concurrently, and experiment with polyrhythms. It serves as a template for creating complex musical compositions using Java's MIDI capabilities.

## Requirements

- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- javax.sound.midi

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Eclipse.
3. Run each of the classes to see the MIDI synthesis and polyrhythmic capabilities in action.

## Classes

### Simple8BitSong

A class that demonstrates the generation of a simple 8-bit song using MIDI synthesis. It includes tracks for bass, melody, and drums.

### Play2Sounds

A class that plays a single sound using the Java Sound API. It demonstrates how to create a sound, play it, and stop it using MIDI synthesis.

### PlaySound

A class that plays a sound and then stops it after a specific duration. It showcases how to control the duration of a sound using the Java Sound API.

### RepeatSoundTest

A class that repeatedly plays a sound with short breaks in between. It demonstrates how to create repetitive sound patterns and control the timing of the sounds.

### Synth

A class that generates and plays a musical tune using Java's MIDI capabilities. It illustrates how to play multiple notes to create a melody.

### SynthFourThreeTest

A class that plays two different melodies concurrently in a polyrhythmic pattern. It demonstrates the synchronization of multiple melodies using MIDI synthesis.

### threeFourPoly

A class that generates and prints a rhythmic pattern in a 3/4 time signature. It demonstrates how to create and visualize a rhythmic pattern for musical composition.

### GptCanonMelodies

A class that creates and plays two separate melodies in a canon format using MIDI sequences. It showcases the simultaneous playback of two different melodies.

### GptTwoDifferentMelodies

A class that plays two distinct melodies at the same time. It demonstrates how to create and play multiple melodies concurrently using the Java Sound API.

Feel free to explore these classes and experiment with the MIDI synthesis and polyrhythmic capabilities of the Java Sound API.
